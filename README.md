#rfLinkConf

## Overview
This project offer a web interface for the RF Link configuration.
I've done that mainly for Somfy RTS, to avoid sending manually the commands.
The project is using nodeJS.
It can run on Linux or Windows. I've never tested MacOS but it should also work.

## How to start
To start the project, you need to specify the RFLink COM port, then:
`node server.js /PortCom`
